# Electric-Vehicle-Data-Analysis-Tableau

## Project Overview:

This Tableau project provides insights into Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption and charging infrastructure development across different regions. The dashboard focuses on EV growth trends, charging station distribution, manufacturer insights, and adoption patterns.

The project consists of three key dashboards:

*   Landing Page –  A high-level summary of EV adoption and charging station availability.


*   Electric Vehicle Data Analysis (Dashboard 1) – Analyzes EV trends, manufacturer dominance, and state-wise distribution.

*   EV Infrastructure & Growth (Dashboard 2) – Focuses on charging station growth, city-wise distribution, and infrastructure 
      expansion.


##   Tools Used :
* Tableau – For building interactive dashboards.
  
* Excel/CSV – Data preprocessing and analysis.


##  Project objective :
   The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and the development of 
      charging infrastructure across different regions using Tableau. The dashboard aims to provide:

* Insights into EV Growth – Track the increasing adoption of EVs over the years.

*  Charging Infrastructure Analysis – Understand the distribution and expansion of charging stations across cities and 
  states.

* Manufacturer & Model Performance – Identify top EV manufacturers and best-selling models.

* CAFV Eligibility Trends – Evaluate how many vehicles qualify under the Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) program.

* EV Adoption vs Charging Locations – Compare the number of EVs per available charging station to analyze infrastructure 
    efficiency.

* Geospatial Analysis – Visualize the geographic distribution of EVs and charging stations using maps.
